<h2>About</h2>
<p>Porsche is a renowned German automobile manufacturer with an emphasis in high-performance luxury sports cars, SUVs and sedans.

Porsche has continued to innovate and pay homage to the original classic through its design accents and curves, Porsche’s current lineup includes the 718 Boxster, Cayman, 911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and the newest all-electric line of Taycans.<hr />
    Not many brands are known across the world, recognizable at first glance with elegance and power. The Porsche brand has left its mark throughout its over 70 year history, becoming known for its stunning timeless designs and pursuit to seamlessly merge style and substance.

Ferdinand Porsche strived to create the perfect car inside and out, refusing to compromise power for style. His efforts led him to designing the first Porsche, a dynamic coupe that combined its modern and unmistakable appearance with a aerodynamic frame and agile performance. Porsche was designed to turn heads and hearts, leaving everyone from the driver and passengers to the spectators satisfied.

A timeless design, the unmistakable silhouette of the 911 is characterized by its iconic flyline. It has barely changed since 1963, and has shaped the DNA of all Porsche models. Including, of course, the 911 Cabriolet and Targa models.

The long, flat hood, the steeply inclined windshield and the roof line that slopes gently down towards the rear, is a cornerstone design found across the Porsche lineup. Uniting traditional and modern design, the Porsche lineup has continued to progress to the future while still paying homage to its past.
